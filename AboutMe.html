<h1>What am I like? Who am I? Why are you here?</h1>
<p>My  name is Chris Andrade. I was forced into this world in June of 2000. I was born and  raised in North Carolina and have lived there my whole life barring 10 months I  spent living in Utah when I was 15. I am initially very quiet around people I&rsquo;m  not familiar with. However, once I become more comfortable, I quickly turn into  probably the most sarcastic person you will ever meet, you know, in case the  welcome page didn&rsquo;t point that out. I enjoy all things computer, from hardware,  to programming, to graphic design (not that I&rsquo;m any good at it) and everything  in between. I also enjoy a good majority of sports, my favorites being  snowboarding and running. Don&rsquo;t ask about why I like running though, I don&rsquo;t know how I  manage to think its suffering and enjoyable at the same time. I also listen to  way too much music, so much so that I apparently listened to more music than  the amount of time that Spotify tracks. Don&rsquo;t ask, I don&rsquo;t know how that math works either. I've also played the majority of sports when I was growing up including rugby, paintball, and a single season of lacross. I've also done a lot of questionable things that are considered extreme sports. For example, I've jumped out of an airplane at 10,000 feet without a parachute on. The fact that I was attached to someone who had one on isn't important right? I've gone cliff diving, I've gone off cliffs while snowboarding, and gone diving with sharks. I'm not exactly the most self-presavative person, but I have fun. I would  add the stereotypical &ldquo;I like learning&rdquo; but that&rsquo;s not entirely true. I LOVE  learning about very specific things, especially if I&rsquo;m passionate about it, I&rsquo;ve spent  literal days studying it for my own amusement and knowledge. For example, more  people are killed by vending machines than sharks per year. Weird huh? I don't think i'll ever understand how anyone dies to a vending machine, but thats not the point I'm trying to make. The point I'm trying to make is that I can learn and remember things rather well. That said, if it&rsquo;s  not something I like or feel is important, I&rsquo;ll likely forget 4 days after I feel its no longer needed. I do typically joke about having the memory of a dead goldfish, and its really not a joke when it comes to most things, I mean, I've forgotten my own birthday twice, so thats something. As for why you're here, Who am I to say? Maybe you were curious about me after an interview, maybe you stalk someone I know and that led you to me, or maybe you stumbled here on accident somehow. Who am I to say that I know why you are here.</p>
